/**
 *  Dependency Inversion Principle
 *  ------------------------------
 *  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
 *  It means that the design should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations. This
 *  principle promotes loose coupling between modules and enables easier substitution of implementations.
