/**
 *  Interface Segregation Principle
 *  -------------------------------
 *  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It means
 *  that you should design fine-grained interfaces that are specific to the needs of
 *  the clients that use them, instead of having large, monolithic interfaces. This
 *  principle helps in decoupling components and reducing the impact of changes.
