/**
 *  Open Closed Principle
 *  ---------------------
 *  Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but
 *  closed for modification. It means that you should design your code in a way that allows
 *  adding new functionality without modifying existing code. This principle is often achieved
 *  through the use of abstractions, interfaces, and polymorphism.
